Hi Kendra,

Thank you for reaching out with this opportunity. I apologize for the delayed response - I've been heads down on current projects.

The LegalTech position looks interesting and aligns well with my React/Node.js expertise. I'm particularly drawn to the international client base and the opportunity to help build the Vietnam team from the ground up.

Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few details:

1. What's the expected timeline for the interview process?
2. Given my 8+ years of full-stack experience and leadership background, how would this typically position within the salary range?
3. What's the expected timeline for starting?
4. Is there potential for salary progression as the Vietnam team grows? (I'm looking for a long-term career opportunity)

I've attached my updated resume for your reference. I'm excited to learn more about the company's Vietnam expansion plans and how I can contribute to this growth.

Best regards,
Duy

P.S. - I appreciate your continued support in my career journey.
