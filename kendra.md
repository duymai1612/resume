Hi Kendra,

Thank you for reaching out with this opportunity. I apologize for the delayed response - I've been heads down on current projects.

The LegalTech position looks interesting and aligns well with my React/Node.js expertise. I'm particularly drawn to the international client base and the opportunity to help build the Vietnam team from the ground up.

Before we proceed, I'd like to clarify a few details:

1. What's the expected timeline for the interview process?
2. Where within the $3-5k range would my 8+ years experience position me?
3. What's the timeline for starting?
4. Is there potential for salary progression as the Vietnam team grows?

I appreciate the opportunity and look forward to learning more about the company's Vietnam expansion plans.

Best regards,
Duy

P.S. - I appreciate your continued support in my career journey.
